            in mathematics and computer science an algorithm calculation ipac en audio en us algorithm ogg &#601;m respell al g&#601; ri dh&#601;m is self contained step by step set of operations to be performed algorithms exist that perform calculation data processing and automated reasoning an algorithm is an effective method that can be expressed within finite amount of space and time ref any classical mathematical algorithm calculation for example can be described in finite number of english words rogers 1987 ref and in well defined formal language ref well defined with respect to the agent that executes the algorithm there is computing agent usually human which can react to the instructions and carry out the computations rogers 1987 ref for calculating function mathematics function ref an algorithm is procedure for computing calculation function with respect to some chosen notation for calculation integers this limitation to numerical functions results in no loss of generality rogers 1987 ref starting from an initial state and initial input perhaps null string empty ref an algorithm has zero or more inputs quantity quantities which are given to it initially before the algorithm begins knuth 1973 ref the instructions describe computation that when execution computing executed proceeds through finite ref procedure which has all the characteristics of an algorithm except that it possibly lacks finiteness may be called computational method knuth 1973 ref number of well defined successive states eventually producing output ref an algorithm has one or more outputs quantities which have specified relation to the inputs knuth 1973 ref and terminating at final ending state calculation the transition from one state to the next calculation is not necessarily deterministic some algorithms known as randomized algorithms incorporate random input ref whether or not process with random interior processes not including the input is an algorithm is debatable
